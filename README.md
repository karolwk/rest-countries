## Overview

The main focus of this projest to reinforce my knowlege of React and TypeScript and also test my understanding of Redux and ReactRouter libraries.
Second objective was to create a single page app and limit number of API requests to bare minimum.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
- Navigate to any country details using /country/countryname route
